# MIPS_32bits_Multicycle
==============

This project implements a MIPS multicycle using the Nexys 4 DDR. The I/O peripherical used are switches, LEDs, and seven-segment displays, written in SystemVerilog.
The 12 User LEDs show the ALU out, and the remaining LEDs represented the FSM state. The seven-segment display the values of the Instruction/Data memory or Register memory.
